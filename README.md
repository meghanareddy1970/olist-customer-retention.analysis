# Olist Customer Retention Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior and revenue structure using the Olist e-commerce dataset.

The objective was to evaluate customer retention patterns, revenue concentration, and the impact of operational performance on repeat purchasing behavior.

---

## Key Questions

- How strong is customer retention?
- Is revenue concentrated among specific customer groups?
- Does late delivery impact repeat purchasing?
- What is the primary business growth lever?

---

## Methodology

1. Aggregated transaction-level data to the customer level.
2. Calculated Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and purchase frequency.
3. Segmented customers into One-Time and Repeat buyers.
4. Corrected reverse causality by analyzing first-order delivery impact.
5. Performed behavioral revenue segmentation.

---

## Key Findings

- ~94% of customers purchase only once.
- Repeat rate is approximately 3%.
- Late first delivery reduces repeat probability by ~20%.
- Revenue is primarily driven by high-spending one-time buyers.
- The company successfully acquires high-value customers but struggles with retention.

---

## Business Implication

The strongest growth opportunity lies in improving first-order experience and converting high-spending one-time buyers into repeat customers.

Operational improvements in delivery performance may directly increase customer retention.
